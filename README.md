## Problem Sets

### PS0

[**All  (3.C01/3.C51, 7.C01/7.C51, 10.C01/10.C51, 20.C01/20.C51)**](https://github.com/coleygroup/ML4MolEng/blob/main/psets/ps0/)

Ungraded problem set to practice using Google Colab and NumPy.


### PS1

Linear classification problem to get you started for the course. You will use logistic regression to diagnose cancer (data size: ~10^2), applying linear methods with L1 and L2 regularization and understand what effects they have on your regression results. 

[**Perovskites  (3.C01/3.C51, 10.C01/10.C51)**](github.com/coleygroup/ML4MolEng/blob/main/psets/ps1-nonbio/)

You will then apply a MLP regressor to predict properties of perovskites (data size: ~10^3) and compare differences between representations of perovskite crystal chemical compositions.


[**MHC  (7.C01/7.C51, 20.C01/20.C51)**](github.com/coleygroup/ML4MolEng/blob/main/psets/ps1-bio/)

You will then apply an MLP regressor to predict MHC binding to peptides (data size: ~10^3) and compare differences between representations of peptide amino acid sequences.


### PS2

For this problem set, you will build a sequence-based model to predict DNA binding sequences (data size: ~10^4) generated with ChIP-seq.

[**Bubbles**](github.com/coleygroup/ML4MolEng/blob/main/psets/ps2-nonbio/)

Next, you will train a model to perform segmentation on images of bubbles (data size: ~10^2) arising from the surface of a catalyst, with the goal of using these insights to improve the design of catalysts.


[**Cells**](github.com/coleygroup/ML4MolEng/blob/main/psets/ps2-bio/)

Next, you will train a model to perform segmentation on images of cells (data size: ~10^2), with the goal of using these insights to better understand cell morphology.

[**PS3**](https://github.com/coleygroup/ML4MolEng/blob/main/psets/ps3/)

Data size: ~10^4

This problem set has two parts: 1) In the first part, you will use PyTorch to train a LSTM-based classifier to classify DNA binding sites. 2) In the second part, you will try to reduce a high-dimensional dataset into lower dimensions with PCA and t-SNE. You will try to find out if the obtained low-dimensional embedding is meaningful. 

This problem set is an application of computer vision to molecular engineering. You will use a deep learning model to classify steel surface defects and perform image segmentation to identify cell nuclei.

[**PS4**](https://github.com/coleygroup/ML4MolEng/blob/main/psets/ps4/)

Data size: ~10^6

This problem set will be more meaty than the previous ones. You will implement your own Graph Neural Nets to predict molecular properties and train a Variational Auto-Encoder to generate new molecules from a learned hidden continuous representation.

[**PS5**](https://github.com/coleygroup/ML4MolEng/blob/main/psets/ps5/)

Data size: ~10^3

This problem set is an application of ML to predicting Solvation Free Energies and participating in a private kaggle dataset challenge.

[**PS6 (SFE)**](https://github.com/coleygroup/ML4MolEng/blob/main/psets/ps6-sfe/)

Data size: ~10^3

You will complete a short clustering exercise and participate in a ML competition to predict drug screen.

[**PS6 (Drug Screen)**](https://github.com/coleygroup/ML4MolEng/blob/master/psets/ps6-drug-screen/)

Data size: ~10^3

You will participate in a ML competition to predict solvation free energies of solute/solvent pairs.
